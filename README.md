FUEL FILLING STATION
AIM: To find the average waiting time of the vehicles that arrive at the fuel filling station.

There are two types of fuels in the fuel filling station namely DIESEL and PETROL.The filling of respective fuel in the vehicle is determined by the information provided by the vehicle owner.
There can be at most 10 vehicles waiting in the queue.Here priorities are given to each and every vehicle that arrives at the station.The priority number one is given to emergency services such as Medical purposes.The second priority is given to government vehicles(for important meetings).And the next priority is given to all others.
Higher the priority lower is the number.
At every instant of time we check whether there is a higher priority vehicle or not.When a vehicle with higher priority arrives at the station all the vehicles with lower priority need to stop and the vehicle with higher priority gets the fuel and then it leaves.Now The remaining vehicles with lower priorities  get the fuel.Here both diesel filling and petrol; filling takes place parallelly.
