FUEL FILLING STATION

OBJECTIVE : 
    To estimate the filling time of each vehicle and to find the average waiting time for all the vehicles present in the fuel filling station.
METHODOLOGY:
•	There are two types of fuels in the fuel filling station: PETROL and DIESEL. The filling of respective fuel in the vehicle is determined by the information       provided by the vehicle owner. There can be at most ten vehicles waiting in the queue. Here priorities are given to every vehicle that arrives at the station. 

•	Priority number one is given to emergency services such as medical purposes. The second priority is given to government vehicles (for important meetings). And the next priority is given to all others. The higher the priority, the lower the number.

•	When a vehicle with higher priority arrives at the station, all the vehicles with lower priority need to stop. The vehicle with higher priority gets the fuel, and then it leaves. The remaining vehicles with lower priorities get the fuel in the next stage. Here both diesel filling and petrol; filling takes place parallelly.

•	Here we have assumed that all the vehicles arrived simultaneously, and the time required to fill a litre of fuel is 30 seconds.
